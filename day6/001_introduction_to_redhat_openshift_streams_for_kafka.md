### Comparison : ZooKeeper vs. KRaft

| Feature                          | ZooKeeper                                   | KRaft (Kafka Raft)                           |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Role in Kafka**                | External dependency for managing metadata, broker coordination, and controller elections | Integrated metadata management, eliminating the need for an external system |
| **Architecture**                 | Separate service, running independently of Kafka brokers | Integrated directly into Kafka brokers |
| **Metadata Storage**             | Stored in ZooKeeper                        | Stored in Kafka itself, using Raft consensus protocol |
| **Leader Election**              | Managed by ZooKeeper                       | Managed internally by KRaft                  |
| **Configuration Management**     | Managed by ZooKeeper                       | Managed internally by KRaft                  |
| **Scalability**                  | Requires careful management of ZooKeeper ensemble | Simplified scalability, as it scales with Kafka brokers |
| **Complexity**                   | More complex due to separate ZooKeeper cluster management | Simpler, with no need for a separate coordination service |
| **Fault Tolerance**              | High, as ZooKeeper is designed for fault tolerance | High, using Raft consensus for fault tolerance and data replication |
| **Latency**                      | Potentially higher due to inter-service communication | Lower, due to integrated architecture       |
| **Operational Overhead**         | Requires separate operational and monitoring efforts for ZooKeeper | Reduced, as all components are managed within Kafka |
| **Adoption**                     | Widely adopted and mature                   | Emerging, with growing adoption in newer Kafka versions |
| **Use Cases**                    | Used by various distributed systems for coordination and metadata management | Primarily designed for Kafka, simplifying Kafka deployments |
| **Management Tools**             | Tools available for managing ZooKeeper clusters (e.g., Exhibitor) | Managed through Kafka's native tools and configurations |
| **Version Availability**         | Available in all stable Kafka versions      | Introduced in Kafka 2.8.0, with improvements in later versions |
| **Community Support**            | Extensive community support and documentation | Growing support, with increasing focus from the Kafka community |

### Key Differences:

1. **Dependency:**
   - **ZooKeeper:** Requires a separate, independently managed cluster.
   - **KRaft:** Integrated into Kafka, removing the need for an external coordination system.

2. **Management Complexity:**
   - **ZooKeeper:** More complex due to the need to manage an additional cluster.
   - **KRaft:** Simplifies the management of Kafka, as there is no separate system to manage.

3. **Scalability and Fault Tolerance:**
   - **ZooKeeper:** Requires careful scaling and management of the ZooKeeper ensemble for fault tolerance.
   - **KRaft:** Scales with Kafka brokers, using the Raft consensus protocol for fault tolerance.

4. **Latency and Performance:**
   - **ZooKeeper:** May introduce higher latency due to inter-service communication.
   - **KRaft:** Offers potentially lower latency and improved performance due to its integrated architecture.

5. **Adoption and Maturity:**
   - **ZooKeeper:** A mature and widely adopted solution with extensive community support.
   - **KRaft:** A newer solution with growing adoption and focus from the Kafka community, particularly in newer Kafka versions.
