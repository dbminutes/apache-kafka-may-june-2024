Kafka Connectors are components provided by Apache Kafka's Kafka Connect framework that enable the integration of Kafka with various data sources and sinks. They allow you to stream data between Kafka and other systems, such as databases, search indexes, and file systems, without writing custom code. Kafka Connectors can be either source connectors (which read data from external systems and write to Kafka topics) or sink connectors (which read data from Kafka topics and write to external systems).

### Key Features of Kafka Connect:
1. **Scalability**: Kafka Connect is distributed and can scale horizontally.
2. **Fault Tolerance**: It provides fault tolerance and automatic recovery for connectors.
3. **Configurability**: Connectors are configurable via simple JSON or properties files.
4. **Schema Management**: It supports schema management and schema evolution through the Kafka Schema Registry.
5. **Rest API**: Kafka Connect offers a REST API for managing connectors.

### How to Use Kafka Connectors:
1. **Install Kafka Connect**: Ensure Kafka Connect is set up and running as part of your Kafka installation.
2. **Configure the Connector**: Create a configuration file (JSON or properties) for the connector specifying connection details, topics, and other settings.
3. **Deploy the Connector**: Use Kafka Connect's REST API or CLI tools to deploy and manage the connectors.
4. **Monitor and Manage**: Monitor the connectors for performance and troubleshoot issues using Kafka Connect's monitoring tools and logs.

### Example Configuration for a JDBC Source Connector:
```json
{
  "name": "jdbc-source-connector",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.confluent.connect.jdbc.JdbcSourceConnector",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "connection.url": "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase",
    "connection.user": "myuser",
    "connection.password": "mypassword",
    "table.whitelist": "mytable",
    "mode": "incrementing",
    "incrementing.column.name": "id",
    "topic.prefix": "jdbc-"
  }
}
```

This configuration file tells Kafka Connect to use the JDBC Source Connector to read from a MySQL database table and write the data to a Kafka topic with a prefix "jdbc-".

Kafka Connectors simplify the process of integrating Kafka with other systems, enabling seamless data streaming and integration capabilities for various use cases.

# Apache Log Connector using file source

To push Apache logs to a Kafka topic, you can use the FileSourceConnector, which reads data from files and pushes it to Kafka. Here's how you can set it up:

### Prerequisites

1. Kafka and Zookeeper are installed and running.
2. Kafka Connect is set up.

### Step 1: Prepare Apache Logs

Ensure your Apache logs are in a file, for example, `access_log`.

### Step 2: Create a Kafka Topic

Create a Kafka topic where the logs will be pushed. Run the following command in your Kafka bin directory:

```sh
/usr/local/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic  apache-logs --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1
```
### Step 3: Configure Kafka Connect

Create a configuration file for the FileSourceConnector. Hereâ€™s an example configuration file named `connect-file-source.properties` (or use existing connector file in config directory):

```properties
name=local-file-source
connector.class=org.apache.kafka.connect.file.FileStreamSourceConnector
tasks.max=1
file=/path/to/apache_logs.log
topic=apache-logs
```

- `name`: A unique name for the connector.
- `connector.class`: The class of the connector.
- `tasks.max`: The maximum number of tasks to use for this connector (set to 1 for simple use).
- `file`: The path to the Apache log file.
- `topic`: The Kafka topic to write the logs to.

### Step 4: Start Kafka Connect

If Kafka Connect is not already running, you can start it with the following command (adjust config file path accordingly):

```sh
/usr/local/kafka/bin/connect-standalone.sh connect-standalone.properties connect-file-source.properties
```

- `connect-standalone.properties`: The properties file for standalone mode.
- `connect-file-source.properties`: The properties file you created in Step 3.

### Step 5: Verify the Data in Kafka

Consume messages from the `apache-logs` topic to verify that the logs are being pushed to Kafka. Run the following command:

```sh
/usr/local/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic apache-logs --from-beginning
```

You should see the log entries from `apache_logs.log` being printed in the console.

### Example Apache Log Entry

Hereâ€™s an example of what an Apache log entry might look like:

```
127.0.0.1 - user [10/Oct/2000:13:55:36 -0700] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.0" 200 2326
```

### Notes

- Ensure the file path in the configuration is correct.
- Make sure Kafka and Zookeeper are running before starting Kafka Connect.
- You may need to adjust the configurations based on your specific setup.
