# What is Apache Kafka?

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It is designed to handle high-throughput, low-latency data stream processing. Kafka enables the publication, subscription, storage, and processing of data streams in a fault-tolerant and scalable manner.

### History and Background

- **Origin:** Apache Kafka was initially developed at LinkedIn by Jay Kreps, Neha Narkhede, and Jun Rao. It was open-sourced in early 2011 and became an Apache Incubator project in 2011.
- **Evolution:** Kafka was designed to address the inefficiencies of existing messaging systems and log aggregation solutions at LinkedIn. It has since evolved into a robust platform for managing real-time data streams.
- **Apache Project:** Kafka graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a top-level Apache project in October 2012.

### Key Features

1. **High Throughput:** Kafka can handle large volumes of data with very low latency, making it suitable for high-throughput use cases.
2. **Scalability:** Kafka is designed to scale horizontally. You can add more brokers to a Kafka cluster to increase its capacity.
3. **Durability:** Kafka persists messages on disk and allows for data replication across multiple nodes to ensure fault tolerance and durability.
4. **Real-time Processing:** Kafka supports real-time data stream processing, enabling applications to process data as it arrives.
5. **Fault Tolerance:** Kafka is designed to be fault-tolerant. If a broker fails, the system continues to function with minimal impact.
6. **Exactly-once Semantics:** Kafka provides exactly-once processing guarantees, ensuring that messages are processed exactly once even in the event of failures.
7. **Multiple Consumers:** Kafka allows multiple consumers to subscribe to the same stream of data and process it independently.
8. **Support for Multiple Data Sources and Sinks:** Kafka Connect provides a framework for connecting Kafka with external systems, making it easy to integrate various data sources and sinks.

## Kafka Protocol Overview

The Kafka protocol is a high-performance, binary protocol designed for communication between Kafka clients (producers, consumers) and Kafka brokers. It supports a variety of operations such as producing and consuming messages, managing offsets, and fetching metadata.

### Main Components

1. **Producer**: Sends messages to Kafka topics.
2. **Consumer**: Reads messages from Kafka topics.
3. **Broker**: Kafka server that stores and serves messages.
4. **Topics**: Logical channels to which messages are sent.
5. **Partitions**: Sub-divisions of topics to distribute load.

### Protocol Operations

1. **Produce**: Send messages to a topic.
2. **Fetch**: Retrieve messages from a topic.
3. **Metadata**: Get metadata about topics, partitions, and brokers.
4. **Offset Commit/Fetch**: Manage consumer offsets.

### Request and Response Structure

Each request and response in the Kafka protocol consists of a fixed header followed by a variable-length payload.

#### Produce Request

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Produce Request] --> B[Header]
    A --> C[Payload]
    B --> D[API Key]
    B --> E[API Version]
    B --> F[Correlation ID]
    B --> G[Client ID]
    C --> H[Topic Name]
    C --> I[Partition]
    C --> J[Message Set]
```

#### Fetch Request

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Fetch Request] --> B[Header]
    A --> C[Payload]
    B --> D[API Key]
    B --> E[API Version]
    B --> F[Correlation ID]
    B --> G[Client ID]
    C --> H[Topic Name]
    C --> I[Partition]
    C --> J[Fetch Offset]
    C --> K[Max Bytes]
```

### Example Produce Request Structure

    B --> G[Client ID: producer-1]
    C --> H[Topic Name: topic-1]
    C --> I[Partition: 0]
    C --> J[Message Set]
    J --> K[Message 1]
    J --> L[Message 2]
    J --> M[...]
```

### Example Fetch Response Structure

    A[Fetch Response] --> B[Header]
    A --> C[Payload]
    B --> D[Correlation ID: 123]
    C --> E[Topic Name: topic-1]
    C --> F[Partition: 0]
    C --> G[Message Set]
    G --> H[Message 1]
    G --> I[Message 2]
    G --> J[...]
```

### Communication Sequence

1. **Producer sends a Produce Request** to the broker with messages for a specific topic and partition.
2. **Broker processes the Produce Request** and stores the messages in the respective partition.
3. **Broker sends a Produce Response** back to the producer indicating success or failure.
4. **Consumer sends a Fetch Request** to the broker specifying the topic, partition, and offset.
5. **Broker processes the Fetch Request** and retrieves the messages from the specified offset.
6. **Broker sends a Fetch Response** back to the consumer with the requested messages.


---------------------------------

>[!NOTE]
>If a producer does not receive a response from the broker after sending data, its behavior depends on the configuration settings and the specific implementation of the Kafka producer. 

### 1. Retries and Acknowledgments

Kafka producers have configurations to handle retries and acknowledgments which influence the behavior when a response is not received:

- **acks**: Determines the number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete. Common settings include:
  - `acks=0`: No acknowledgment is required from the broker (fire-and-forget).
  - `acks=1`: The leader broker must write the record to its local log but does not wait for all followers to replicate the record.
  - `acks=all` (or `acks=-1`): The leader waits for the full set of in-sync replicas to acknowledge the record.

- **retries**: Specifies the number of times the producer will attempt to send the data again if an acknowledgment is not received. The default value is typically set to `2147483647` (maximum integer), meaning it will retry indefinitely.

- **retry.backoff.ms**: The amount of time to wait before attempting to retry a failed request to a given topic partition.

### 2. Timeouts and Error Handling

- **request.timeout.ms**: The configuration controls the maximum amount of time the producer will wait for a broker to acknowledge a request. If the timeout is reached without a response, the producer will consider the request as failed and will retry based on the `retries` setting.

- **max.in.flight.requests.per.connection**: Limits the number of unacknowledged requests the client will send on a single connection before blocking. If set to 1, it ensures that messages are sent in order, but setting it to a higher value can improve throughput at the cost of potentially out-of-order delivery in case of retries.

### 3. Scenario and Flow

#### Normal Flow with Response
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Producer
    participant Broker

    Producer->>Broker: Produce Request
    Broker-->>Producer: Produce Response (Acknowledgment)
    Producer->>Producer: Mark request as successful
```

#### No Response from Broker (Retries Enabled)
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Producer
    participant Broker

    Producer->>Broker: Produce Request
    Broker-->>Producer: No Response (Timeout)
    Producer->>Producer: Check retry count
    Producer->>Producer: Increment retry count
    Producer->>Broker: Produce Request (Retry)
    Broker-->>Producer: Produce Response (Acknowledgment)
    Producer->>Producer: Mark request as successful
```

### Example Configuration
Here's an example of how you might configure a Kafka producer to handle retries and acknowledgments:

```java
Properties props = new Properties();
props.put("bootstrap.servers", "broker1:9092,broker2:9092");
props.put("acks", "all"); // Wait for all in-sync replicas to acknowledge
props.put("retries", 3); // Retry up to 3 times
props.put("retry.backoff.ms", 100); // 100 ms backoff between retries
props.put("request.timeout.ms", 30000); // 30 seconds timeout
props.put("max.in.flight.requests.per.connection", 5); // Allow up to 5 unacknowledged requests
props.put("key.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
props.put("value.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");

KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);
```

### Key Points

1. **Retry Mechanism**: The producer will retry sending the message if it does not receive an acknowledgment from the broker, based on the `retries` setting.
2. **Timeout Handling**: The producer will wait for the duration specified in `request.timeout.ms` before considering the request as failed and retrying.
3. **Data Consistency**: With `acks=all`, the producer ensures higher consistency by waiting for all in-sync replicas to acknowledge the message, reducing the likelihood of data loss.
