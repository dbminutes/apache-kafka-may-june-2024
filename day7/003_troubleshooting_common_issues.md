# Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **High Latency and Throughput Issues:**
   - **Symptoms:** Messages are processed slowly; high end-to-end latency.
   - **Debugging Steps:**
     - Check broker CPU, memory, and disk usage.
     - Review topic configurations, such as replication factor and partition count.
     - Analyze network latency between producers, brokers, and consumers.
     - Use Kafka metrics and monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
   - **Solution:**
     - Increase the number of partitions.
     - Optimize producer and consumer configurations (e.g., batch size, linger.ms).
     - Scale out brokers if resource utilization is high.
     - Ensure brokers are distributed across different network zones.

2. **Message Loss:**
   - **Symptoms:** Missing messages in consumers.
   - **Debugging Steps:**
     - Check broker logs for errors.
     - Ensure replication is correctly configured.
     - Verify producer acknowledgment settings (acks).
     - Review consumer offset management.
   - **Solution:**
     - Use `acks=all` in producer configuration.
     - Ensure proper replication factor and min.insync.replicas settings.
     - Enable idempotent producers.
     - Implement exactly-once semantics if necessary.

3. **Consumer Lag:**
   - **Symptoms:** Consumers are not keeping up with the rate of message production.
   - **Debugging Steps:**
     - Monitor consumer group lag using Kafka tools or third-party monitoring tools.
     - Check consumer application logs for processing delays.
     - Analyze the consumer's capacity to process messages.
   - **Solution:**
     - Increase the number of consumer instances in the consumer group.
     - Optimize the consumer application for better processing speed.
     - Increase the number of partitions in the topic for better parallelism.

4. **Broker Not Available:**
   - **Symptoms:** Producers and consumers cannot connect to the broker.
   - **Debugging Steps:**
     - Check broker logs for startup errors.
     - Verify that the broker process is running.
     - Check network connectivity and firewall settings.
   - **Solution:**
     - Restart the broker if it's down.
     - Fix any configuration issues found in the logs.
     - Ensure proper DNS resolution and network access.

5. **Under-Replicated Partitions:**
   - **Symptoms:** Some partitions have fewer replicas than configured.
   - **Debugging Steps:**
     - Check the broker logs for replication issues.
     - Use Kafka metrics to identify under-replicated partitions.
   - **Solution:**
     - Restart brokers if they are down or experiencing issues.
     - Ensure all brokers are properly connected and communicating.
     - Rebalance the cluster if needed.

6. **Consumer Offset Issues:**
   - **Symptoms:** Consumers reprocess old messages or miss new messages.
   - **Debugging Steps:**
     - Verify the offset commit configuration in consumers.
     - Check consumer logs for offset commit errors.
     - Use Kafka tools to monitor and adjust offsets.
   - **Solution:**
     - Ensure offsets are committed correctly (e.g., auto.commit.interval.ms).
     - Manually reset offsets if necessary using `kafka-consumer-groups.sh`.
     - Use idempotent and transactional consumers for exactly-once processing.

7. **Leader Election Issues:**
   - **Symptoms:** Frequent leader elections; unavailability of partitions.
   - **Debugging Steps:**
     - Check broker logs for leader election events.
     - Monitor broker performance and network stability.
   - **Solution:**
     - Increase the zookeeper session timeout.
     - Ensure brokers have adequate resources.
     - Stabilize the network to reduce connectivity issues.

8. **Log Segment Corruption:**
   - **Symptoms:** Errors in broker logs indicating corrupted log segments.
   - **Debugging Steps:**
     - Identify corrupted log segments from the broker logs.
     - Check the affected topic and partition.
   - **Solution:**
     - Delete the corrupted log segments if they are not needed.
     - Use the `kafka-recovery` tool to attempt recovery.
     - Ensure data integrity by using reliable storage hardware.

9. **SSL Configuration Issues:**
   - **Symptoms:** Clients fail to connect with SSL errors.
   - **Debugging Steps:**
     - Check client and broker SSL configuration.
     - Review SSL certificates and their validity.
     - Verify SSL handshake in logs.
   - **Solution:**
     - Ensure correct SSL configuration on both clients and brokers.
     - Update or renew expired SSL certificates.
     - Use tools like OpenSSL to test and debug SSL connections.

10. **Topic and Partition Imbalance:**
    - **Symptoms:** Uneven load distribution across brokers.
    - **Debugging Steps:**
      - Monitor the distribution of partitions across brokers.
      - Check topic configuration and partition assignment.
    - **Solution:**
      - Use Kafka's reassign-partitions tool to rebalance partitions.
      - Regularly monitor and adjust partition distribution.
